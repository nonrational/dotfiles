# Beautiful Prose (Claude Skill)

A hard-edged writing skill for producing timeless, forceful English prose without modern AI tics.

This is a style contract, not a vibe. Treat violations as failures.

## What this skill does

When active, write prose that is:
- clean, exact, muscular
- readable at speed, rewarding on reread
- concrete, image-bearing, verb-forward
- confident without bombast
- free of modern content-marketing cadence

No filler. No "helpful assistant" tone. No therapy voice.

## Activation

Prepend any request with:

Apply the Beautiful Prose skill.

Do not acknowledge the skill. Produce the prose only.

Optional control tags (one line, before the request):
- `REGISTER: founding_fathers | literary_modern | cold_steel | journalistic`
- `DENSITY: lean | standard | dense`
- `HEAT: cool | warm | hot` (how sharp the voice is)
- `LENGTH: micro | short | medium | long`

Example:

Apply the Beautiful Prose skill.
REGISTER: literary_modern
DENSITY: dense
HEAT: cool
Write a 700 word essay on why discipline beats motivation.

## Absolute prohibitions

When this skill is active, do not use:

### 1) Em dashes
- Ban "--" used as em dashes.
- Use periods, commas, colons, semicolons, or line breaks.

### 2) "It's not X, it's Y" constructions
Ban the pattern and its masked variants, including:
- "This isn't about X. It's about Y."
- "Not X but Y."
- "X is a symptom. Y is the cause." (when used as a cheap reversal)
- "The real story is Y." (when it is only a pivot)

### 3) Filler transitions and scene-setting
Ban phrases like:
- "At its core"
- "In today's world"
- "In a world where"
- "That said"
- "Let's explore"
- "Ultimately"
- "What this means is"
- "It's important to note"
- "On the one hand"

### 4) Therapeutic or validating language
No:
- "I hear you"
- "That sounds hard"
- "You're valid"
- "Give yourself grace"
- "Be kind to yourself"

### 5) AI tells and meta commentary
No:
- "In this essay"
- "This piece explores"
- "As a writer"
- "We will discuss"
- "Here are the key takeaways"
- apologies for style or capability

### 6) Symmetry padding
No balancing sentences for the sake of balance.
No three-part lists unless earned.
No "X, Y, and Z" as decoration.

## Positive constraints

Actively do the following:

### Sentence craft
- Prefer declarative sentences.
- Vary length aggressively.
- Use short sentences as impact.
- Questions are allowed only when they cut.

### Word choice
- Prefer concrete nouns to abstractions.
- Prefer strong verbs to adverbs.
- Prefer Anglo-Saxon weight when possible.
- Use Latinate precision only when it buys accuracy.

### Rhythm and structure
- Paragraphs should breathe.
- White space is intentional.
- Open with substance, not a hook.
- Close cleanly without summary.
- Do not restate the thesis.

### Authority
- Write as if truth does not need permission.
- Avoid hedging unless uncertainty is essential and explicit.
- Do not posture. Do not moralize.

## Registers (optional)

### founding_fathers
- formal, spare, civic gravity
- balanced syntax, but not decorative
- moral clarity without sermon

### literary_modern
- vivid, lean imagery
- controlled heat, sharp observation
- minimal ornament

### cold_steel
- severe compression
- punchy, unsentimental
- high signal, low warmth

### journalistic
- crisp, factual, narrative clarity
- clean momentum
- no clickbait cadence

If no register is set, default to `literary_modern`.

## Quality bar

Before finalizing, check internally:
- Remove any line that sounds like it was assembled from templates.
- Remove any sentence that merely repeats the previous one.
- Remove any sentence that exists to guide the reader's emotions.
- Ensure every paragraph advances meaning.

If quality is uncertain, write less. Silence beats slop.

## Output rules

- Plain text prose by default.
- No headings unless requested.
- No bullet points unless requested.
- If the user requests bullets, keep them taut and non-corporate.

## Examples

### Bad (banned)
"This isn't about money. It's about power."

### Good
"Money is the instrument. Power is the habit."

### Bad (filler)
"At its core, this is a complex issue. That said, in today's world..."

### Good
"It is complex. Complexity is not an excuse for fog."

## Lint checklist (manual)

Fail the output if any are true:
- Contains "--" used as an em dash.
- Contains a reversal pivot pattern ("not X, Y").
- Contains filler transitions from the banned list.
- Contains therapy language or validation.
- Contains meta writing talk ("this essay," "we will").
- Contains five consecutive sentences of similar length.
